### Welcome

Mybrary was built using Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB.  It is an application designed for avid readers who want to catalog their journey. Users will be able to create an ongoing collection of books they've read, as well as document their rating and comments on the book, so that they are able to organize their thoughts. They will also have the ability to create a wishlist of future books theyâ€™d like to read and also rank them based on priority. As their journey continues, they will be able to create, edit, or even delete their entries; should they choose to do so.

The Mybrary app can be access on [Heroku](https://mybrarysei322.herokuapp.com/), or by forking and cloning the [Frontend](https://github.com/mybrary/frontend) and [Backend](https://github.com/mybrary/backend).
